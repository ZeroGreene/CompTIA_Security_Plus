CompTIA Security+ topics are organized into five core domains: General Security Concepts, covering foundational principles like CIA and cryptographic solutions; Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations, focusing on various attacks, malware, and indicators of compromise; Security Architecture, which involves designing and applying secure network and infrastructure models; Security Operations, encompassing tasks like identity and access management, vulnerability management, and incident response; and Security Program Management and Oversight, addressing risk management, governance, and compliance.  
Here is a breakdown of topics within each domain for the CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 exam:
